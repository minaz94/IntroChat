## “IntroChat” is an innovative iOS application designed to offer a personalized and interactive way for users to introduce themselves. Utilizing a user-friendly interface, this app invites individuals to enter their personal details which are then creatively displayed in an alert. This app not only demonstrates my skills in iOS development, particularly in implementing UserDefaults for data persistence, but also showcases creativity in enhancing user interaction. It's a perfect tool for those who love sharing about themselves and their furry friends!
